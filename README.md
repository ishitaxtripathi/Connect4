# Connect4dots

It's a desktop application developed with the help of javafx.
-----About the game-----
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a colour 
and then take turns dropping coloured discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. 
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. 
(Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.)
We created an executable jar file as a desktop application and to provide the project to people in more user friendly ways. 
-----How to play-----
